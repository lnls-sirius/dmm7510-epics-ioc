\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{} The Direct-Current Current Transformer (DCCT) is the sensor responsible for measuring the beam average current. The DCCT application software is responsible for making DCCT measurements and configuration options available as EPICS Process Variables (PVs).

%--- Section: Instrument Setup ---
\section{Instrument Setup}
\subsection{Common Instrument Setup}

	\paragraph{} The complete DCCT measurement setup consists of a DCCT (Bergoz NPCT) mounted in the beam line; a digital multimeter (Kethley DMM7510) connected to the DCCT output terminals; a STD-EVE timing module, which has a multimeter trigger output connected to its rear panel and one of its front panel outputs connected to the multimeter trigger input; a PC which communicates with the digital multimeter; a connection to a remote module from the interlock system for DCCTs in the Storage Ring.

\FloatBarrier

	\paragraph{} The NPCT (New Parametric Current Transformer) is a comercial DCCT, fabricated by Bergoz Instrumentation, widely used in particles accelerators around the world for measuring average beam current. The instrument generates a voltage output, in the 0 to 10 volts range, proportional to the current flowing through its toroid.

	\paragraph{} The Kethley DMM7510 digital multimeter is connected to the NPCT voltage output and is used to acquire, convert, and filter the sensor data. For the Storage Ring DCCT, the multimeter is also responsible for generating a trigger to the STD-EVE timing module whenever the current falls below a specified threshold, indicating that the beam has been lost.

	\paragraph{} The STD-EVE timing module can trigger multimeter readings, and monitor the multimeter output trigger line. Upon trigger reception, the STD-EVE generates a post-mortem event that is broadcast to the entire Timing System.

	\paragraph{} The PC runs an EPICS IOC, which includes DMM7510 multimeter and DCCT application-specific PVs. The application reads the multimeter data regularly and configures the multimeter's parameters according to the settings defined in the application PVs.

 	\paragraph{} The connection to the interlock system consists of 2 signals for the sensor in the sector 14C4 of the Storage Ring. A monitor signal for the interlock to read the current NPCT electronics range configuration, which is defined by the DMM7510 multimeter, and a copy of the NPCT measurement output signal, provided on the front panel of the electronics. For the sensor at the sector 13C4, which is considered by the interlock system as the the most reliable source of current reading, only the DCCT measurement output signal is provided, since the NPCT range is fixed for greater safety. The DCCT in the Booster is not connected to the interlock system. More details are provided in \emph{\nameref{sec:integration-interlock}}.

\subsection{DCCT Integration to Interlock}\label{sec:integration-interlock}

	\paragraph{} The Sirius personal protection system uses the DCCT measurement as one of the variables to determine if there is an electron beam inside of the accelerator tunnel. The presence of beam is used in the interlock logic for personal protection. To minimize the number of points of failure in the measurement process for interlock, the interlock system bypasses the digital multimeter and is connected directly to the NPCT electronics instead. The NPCT electronics has an additional signal output on the front panel (besides the main signal output on the back). This front output is connected to an analog input channel of a remote input/output module which is located in the same rack as the NPCT electronics. The interlock system converts the analog reading from the NPCT output to a current measurement value. For greater safety, the range of the NPCT corresponding to the DCCT in sector 13C4 of the Storage Ring is fixed by hardware by means of a jumper connected to the NPCT electronics configuration input connector. The software can be configured through the device option during deploy to disable range configuration so that the digital multimeter and the NPCT electronics are always consistency regarding the measurement range. This guarantees that the reading displayed in the control room and archived is consistent to the measured value. The interlock system is not impacted by the software readings, since the multimeter is bypassed for the interlock.

%--- Section: Measurement Overview ---
\section{Measurement Overview}

	\subsection{Storage Ring} 

		\paragraph{} Storage Ring beam current is measured periodically in fixed time steps. The measurement trigger can be provided by software or by an external trigger pulse. When software triggering is selected, the DCCT application issues measurement commands at a "as fast as possible" rate, which is constrained by the measurement duration. Therefore, the software triggering rate is defined by the measurement period plus some latency, up to 50 Hz. When external triggering is selected, the multimeter starts a measurement once an external trigger is received from the Timing System. The IOC monitoring rate and data transfer latency limit the effective measurement rate, which cannot be as fast with external triggering as with software triggering.

		\paragraph{} Another important task of the Storage Ring DCCT system is to inform the Timing System whenever the beam current falls below a minimum threshold. If configured to do so, the multimeter constantly monitors the DCCT output while acquisition is enabled, comparing it to the specified threshold. When the current level falls below the threshold, the multimeter outputs a trigger pulse to a STD-EVE timing module in less than \SI{2}{\micro\second}.

	\subsection{Booster} 

		\paragraph{} The Booster beam current measurements must be correlated to each separate Booster ramp cycle, requiring a triggering mechanism. The measurement trigger in this application can be provided by an external trigger pulse or by the beam current level itself. When in external trigger mode, the multimeter measurements are triggered by the STD-EVE module at each Booster ramp cycle. When triggered by current level, a measurement starts when the input signal becomes greater than the specified threshold.

%--- Section: DCCT Software Configuration Steps ---
\section{DCCT Software Configuration}

	\paragraph{} This section describes the basic steps when configuring the DCCT application. Further detail about the DCCT application PVs can be found in \emph{\nameref{sec:process-variables}}.

	\bigskip
	\noindent\adjustbox{minipage=\textwidth,cfbox=red 1.0pt 2ex}{
		It is necessary to \hyperref[acquisition-start]{disable acquisition} before making any changes to the application settings. All of the set point and selection PVs are disabled while the enble status is \emph{ON}. This avoids incorrect measurements, false post-mortem signal generation, temporary communication loss with the multimeter, or even the need to power cycle the multimeter.
	}

	\bigskip
	\noindent\adjustbox{minipage=\textwidth,cfbox=red 1.0pt 2ex}{A new \hyperref[relative-offset]{voltage relative offset} should be acquired every time the range configuration or measurement mode are modified.}

	\bigskip
	\noindent\adjustbox{minipage=\textwidth,cfbox=red 1.0pt 2ex}{When the application is configured for either \emph{External} or \emph{Input-Level-based} triggering, the interval between triggers should be greater than the measurement period by roughly 100 ms. This is necessary to guarantee that the multimeter has enough time to acquire and send the data to the IOC, otherwise triggers issued too soon are ignored.}

	\subsection{Mesurement Mode}\label{measurement-mode}

		\paragraph{Measurement mode selection}\label{measurement-mode-selection} The DMM7510 multimeter can operate in two different acquisition modes, the \emph{Measure} and \emph{Digitize} modes. In the DCCT IOC these modes are referred to as \emph{Normal} and \emph{Fast} modes, respectively. The \emph{Normal} mode provides greater resolution (7 and 1/2 digits, compared to 4 digits for \emph{Fast} mode), while the \emph{Fast} mode can provide slightly higher sample rates and greater resolution (1 more digit than \emph{Normal} mode) for high sample rates (1 Ksamples/s to 1 Msamples/s).

	\bigskip
	\noindent\adjustbox{minipage=\textwidth,cfbox=teal 1.0pt 2ex}{The PVs in the \hyperref[measurement-settings]{Measurement Settings} section are divided in two groups, depending on the type of measurement they are associated with: PVs for the \emph{Normal Mode}, and PVs for the \emph{Fast Mode}.}

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Set \emph{MeasMode-Sel} PV to the desired mode: \emph{Normal} or \emph{Fast}.
				\item Wait until \emph{MeasMode-Sts} has changed to the chosen option and all the other settings have stabilized in the selected values (this takes a few seconds).
			\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Measurement triggering}

		\paragraph{Disable triggering}\label{disable-triggering} It might be useful, in some cases, to disable measurement triggering. In this configuration, all trigger types are disabled.

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Set \emph{MeasTrg-Sel} PV to \emph{None}.
				\item Wait until \emph{MeasTrg-Sts} has changed to \emph{None}.
			\end{enumerate}

		\paragraph{Software triggering} In the software triggering mode, the DMM7510 multimeter starts measurements in response to periodic software requests.

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Set \emph{MeasTrg-Sel} PV to \emph{Software}.
				\item Wait until \emph{MeasTrg-Sts} has changed to \emph{Software}.
			\end{enumerate}

		\paragraph{External triggering} In the external triggering mode, the DMM7510 multimeter starts measurements in response to external trigger reception, while software periodically monitors the device to retrieve the newest measurement available.

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Set \emph{MeasTrg-Sel} PV to \emph{External}.
				\item Wait until \emph{MeasTrg-Sts} has changed to \emph{External}.
			\end{enumerate}

		\paragraph{Input level based triggering} In level based triggering mode, the DMM7510 multimeter starts measurements in response to any beam current rising edge that goes above the specified threshold.

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Set \emph{Range-Sel} to the desired DCCT sensor range.
				\item Verify if \emph{Range-Sts} has changed accordingly.
				\item Set \emph{CurrThold-SP} to the current level threshold intended to trigger measurements.
				\item Verify if \emph{CurrThold-RB} has changed accordingly.
				\item Set \emph{HFReject-Sel} to indicate if high frequency rejection should be used.
				\item Verify if \emph{HFReject-Sts} has changed accordingly.
				\item Set \emph{MeasTrg-Sel} to \emph{InLevel}.
				\item Wait until \emph{MeasTrg-Sts} has changed to \emph{InLevel}.
			\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{DCCT Range selection}

		\paragraph{} The selected DCCT sensor range should never be smaller than the current passing through the sensor. Currents exceeding the full scale range may saturate the sensor magnetic cores. In order to desaturate it, power cycle the NPCT electronics.

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Set \emph{Range-Sel} to the desired DCCT sensor range.
				\item Verify if \emph{Range-Sts} has changed accordingly.
			\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Low beam current detection}

		\paragraph{} Low beam current detection is used for post-mortem signal generation. \emph{This feature cannot be used along with input-level-based measurement triggering}.

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Set \emph{Range-Sel} to the desired DCCT sensor range.
				\item Verify if \emph{Range-Sts} has changed accordingly.
				\item Set \emph{CurrThold-SP} to the desired current level threshold.
				\item Verify if \emph{CurrThold-RB} has changed accordingly.
				\item Set \emph{HFReject-Sel} to indicate if high frequency rejection should be used.
				\item Verify if \emph{HFReject-Sts} has changed accordingly.
				\item Set \emph{LowLimEnbl-Sel} to \emph{ON}.
				\item Verify if \emph{LowLimEnbl-Sts} status is \emph{ON}.

			\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Stored Beam Status Configuration}

%--- Section: Reading Measurements from PVs ---
\section{Reading Measurements from PVs}

	\paragraph{} The DCCT measurement data is available in the following EPICS PVs.

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \emph{RawReadings-Mon} stores the last measurement waveform acquired.
			\item \emph{Current-Mon} stores the average of the last waveform acquired, which represents the latest measurement.
			\item \emph{CurrHstr-Mon} is a circular buffer storing the last 1000 measurements from \emph{Current-Mon}.
			\item \emph{Timestamp-Mon} stores the timestamp from \emph{Current-Mon} as a double representation of UTC in seconds and subseconds since 1 January 1970.
			\item \emph{TimestampHstr-Mon} is a circular buffer storing the last 1000 values from \emph{Timestamp-Mon}.
			\item \emph{ClearHstr-Cmd} clears both \emph{CurrHstr-Mon} and \emph{TimestampHstr-Mon} circular buffers, when set to 1. This command is useful when there are old or invalid values in the history that should be discarded before some high level task is executed.
			\item \emph{ReliableMeas-Mon} indicates if the DCCT application measurements at each instant are reliable. This PV is an \emph{OR} of the \emph{temperature calibration warning}, \emph{network disconnect status} and \emph{acquisition disabled status}. If any of these conditions are true, a measurement update is not considered to be reliable.

		MeasTrg-Sel & ENUM: None, External, InLevel, Software & \begin{tabular}{@{}m{6cm}@{}}
				      	  Measurement trigger source. When set to \emph{External}, the multimeter measurements are triggered by an external trigger. When set to \emph{InLevel}, measurements are triggered when the input signal exceeds the specified threshold (rising edge transition). For both \emph{External} and \emph{InLevel} triggering, the software fetchs priodically the latest reading stored in the multimeter's buffer. When set to \emph{Software}, measurements are requested periodically by software.
